  Artist RabbitinM received a similar scam in an art proposal. He was sent a zip file containing a technical specification (technical assignment) from the customer, with examples and sketches.

  What seemed like a normal suggestion turned out to be malicious after the artist lost everything and carefully checked the contents of the archive.

  After opening the zip file, we can see a PDF file containing the customer's sketches, however, this is not a normal PDF file. It is actually a Windows desktop screensaver file with a .scr extension, which is a malicious script disguised as a PDF..
