  Sellers receive a message where a buyer wants to purchase a product and offers to arrange it through OLX delivery. Then he provides a link to a third-party site, where he asks to enter personal data, as well as bank card data. The same thing happens with buyers: they are also asked to fill out a certain form and enter data. As a rule, as a result of this, money is withdrawn from the victim's card. After receiving the money, the scammers stop communicating.
