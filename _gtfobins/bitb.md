  . Alternatively, they could choose an attractive address and content that may lure
  victims — such as shopping deals, job opportunities, or news a user might want to comment on. The criminals set things
  up so that visitors need to sign in if they want to buy something, comment, or access other features that interest
  them. Then the malefactors add buttons that supposedly permit logging in through the legitimate services they want
  to harvest passwords from. If victims click on such a button, they’ll see a login window they’re familiar with, such
  as a Microsoft, Google, or Apple prompt, with the correct address, logo, and input fields — in short, all the
  components of the interface they’re used to seeing. The window can even display correct addresses when users hover
  the mouse over the “Log in” button and “Forgot password” link. The catch is that this isn’t actually a separate window
  — this marvel of deception is scripted to appear right on the page that is trying to trick the user. If you enter your
  credentials in this window, they won’t go to Microsoft, Google, or Apple, but rather straight
  to the cybercriminal’s server.
