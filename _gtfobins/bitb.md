description: A BitB attack is a novel phishing technique that replicates pop-up windows used for SSO in an effort to steal login credentials.
description: This type of attack, which has come to be known as a “browser-in-the-browser” attack was described by an infosec researcher and pentester going by the handle mr.d0x. He noticed that modern means of creating websites (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools) have become so advanced they can display practically anything on the page: from fields of any color or shape, to animation that imitates the moving components of the interface. This means that a phisher can also use them to simulate a full-fledged page from a different service inside their own website.
