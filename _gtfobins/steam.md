  Steam users have been targeted by hackers using Browser-in-the-Browser (BiTB) phishing attacks to steal their credentials. 

  The new attack method includes developing a fake browser window within an active window to mimic a sign-in page for a particular login service. The phishing kit isn't easily procurable on hacking forums or the dark web. Instead, hackers use Discord or Telegram channels to gain easy access to the new phishing kit. Threat actors intend to sell access to these hacked accounts, starting from $100,000 to $300,000.

  The targets are sent direct invitation links on their Steam account, requesting them to join a team for LoL, CS, Dota 2, or PUBG competitions. Once the link is clicked, they are directed to a phishing site organizing esports competitions.
