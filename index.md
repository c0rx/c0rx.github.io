SCAM|MPACT is designed to prevent the development of scam success rates among people. 

Our project gathers all scam [techniques](/techniques/) and examples of them with preventative measurements. Most people will find this project helpful when faced with some sort of suspicious moments. 

Do not know what to do when someone sends a link for a money withdrawal? Or a real estate agent asking for money for an apartment presentation? All this information is placed here in one project.

If you would like to contribute to our project: a new technique of scam or an interesting case just send hit the "Contribute" button.
